## Happness is...

Bringing ideas to life in an app or website is extremely satisfying. Those first steps can be overwelming and stop a great idea in it's tracks. Here's where I play a part. My skills in coding and design, will get you past those first steps and set you running. With this new momentum, you can show the world your app, your idea, your passion. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/FrankMarks21/FrankMarks21.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
